# Console-Finances

## Description
This repository applies the principles acquired in fundamental JavaScript to solve a practical scenario. The objective was to develop code for examining a company's financial records using a provided financial dataset. The employed skills encompass pseudocoding, variable usage, for loops, mathematical operations, working with multidimensional arrays, and implementing conditional logic.

## Issues
I struggled with directly analyzing a 2D array, so I took a longer route. I split the data into two arrays, performed operations, and then used indices to get the values. This was due to my limited knowledge and the absence of information on finding the average of differences in a 2D array without using functions, which is beyond the project's scope. I found info on column averages but not for differences.

## Usage 
The analysis can be accessed from this link: https://russkinori.github.io/Console-Finances/. Please see below for instructions and screenshots.
